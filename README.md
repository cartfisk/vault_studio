## About This Fork

`{ vault.studio }` is an independent, artist-focused fork of [{ vault }](https://github.com/bungleware/vault) by [bungleware](https://github.com/bungleware). The original developer created the core application and the large majority of its foundation. This fork builds on that work with additional tools for artists, demos, and mobile listening; it is not intended to diminish or replace the upstream project.

The project is also inspired by [untitled](https://untitled.stream/), while remaining open source and self-hosted.

## What {vault.studio} Adds

- Native Android app with a selectable self-hosted backend URL, including raw HTTP support for local networks
- Android media controls and track metadata for the notification player and connected devices
- Automatic BPM and musical-key analysis, plus manual re-detection
- Rich per-track notes with formatting and autosave
- Mobile voice-memo capture that uploads ideas directly into a project
- Animated artwork management and previews for Apple Music `1:1` and `3:4` motion artwork and Spotify Canvas `9:16` video
- Light, Default, Black, and System themes with a configurable accent color
- Mobile-focused layouts, edge-to-edge Android presentation, and gesture-aware navigation

### Motion Artwork Preview

Upload animated artwork once and inspect it in responsive, platform-inspired previews before delivery. `{ vault.studio }` retains the original source, creates a silent browser-compatible preview with FFmpeg, and checks dimensions, duration, codec, frame rate, bitrate, and audio presence against the selected format. Apple Music portrait previews also simulate the live blurred color continuation behind the player controls as the artwork changes.

> [!NOTE]
> Animated artwork previews are an informed estimation, not a pixel-perfect reproduction of Apple Music or Spotify. Final rendering can vary by platform, device, operating system, and app version.

## Core {vault} Features

These features come from the upstream project and remain central to this fork:

- Store and stream audio projects and track versions
- Invite users and collaborate within one instance
- Share projects and tracks publicly with download, password, and permission controls
- Organize projects in nested folders
- Export and import an instance as a ZIP backup

## Install

### Android

Download the APK from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/ILostXD/vault_studio/releases/latest). Android may ask you to allow installs from your browser or file manager.

On first launch, enter the full URL of your self-hosted instance, including `http://` or `https://` and its port when required.

### Self-hosted Server

Requires Git, Docker, and Docker Compose. This fork currently builds locally from source; no prebuilt container image is published.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ILostXD/vault_studio.git
cd vault_studio
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `JWT_SECRET`, `SIGNED_URL_SECRET`, and `TOKEN_PEPPER` in `.env` to different random values. Generate each value with:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Then build and start the application:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

The app is available at `http://localhost:8080` by default. Runtime data is stored in `./data`.

To update an existing checkout:

```bash
git pull --ff-only
docker compose up -d --build
```

## Configuration

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret used to sign access tokens | Required |
| `SIGNED_URL_SECRET` | Secret used to sign media URLs | Required |
| `TOKEN_PEPPER` | Pepper used when hashing tokens | Required |
| `HOST_PORT` | Port exposed on the host | `8080` |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL` | Access-token lifetime | `15m` |
| `REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL` | Refresh-token lifetime | `720h` |
| `SIGNED_URL_TTL` | Signed media URL lifetime | `5m` |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated additional frontend origins | Local defaults |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Log verbosity (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`) | `warn` |

Most of the original application was created by [bungleware](https://github.com/bungleware) and the [{ vault } contributors](https://github.com/bungleware/vault/graphs/contributors). Fork-specific additions are maintained in this repository. See the Git history for a complete attribution trail.

The animated fullscreen artwork background was informed by Aadish Verma's research, [Reverse engineering Apple Music's background gradient](https://www.aadishv.dev/music). Vault Studio's implementation was written independently using the existing React and CSS animation stack.
